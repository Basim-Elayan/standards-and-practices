A subscription with Row Forge entitles you to additional features within the app, including: health tracking and statistics, customized workouts, and in-app badges. There are two subscription period options: one (1) month recurring monthly, or one (1) year recurring yearly. You can be subscribed to only one subscription option at a time. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Renewal price is the same as the listed price for each subscription level. You can manage your subscription and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your iTunes Account Settings page after purchase. You may cancel or switch between subscription options at any time. Canceling your subscription will return you to a free account.
