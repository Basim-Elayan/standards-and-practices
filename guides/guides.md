# Shift3 Guides

A Shift3 guide is a designation that any Shift3 developer can receive and allows the holder of the Guide designation to
be involved in various training opportunities with new hires.  The role of guide is not one to be taken lightly; it
should be viewed as our primary source of knowledge transfer to new hires.  The ultimate goal of the Guide is to ensure
that new hires are onboarded in a way that both makes them productive as soon as possible, but also to ensure that the
new hire has a point of contact, someone to grab a coffee with, and generally bounce questions off of.
